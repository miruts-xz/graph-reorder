# Graph Reordering #
This readme provides how to use and run different reordering methods, test reordering methods, and how to run simulations on those reordered graphs.
## These Reordering methods include: ##
- Degree reordering
- Clustering
- [GOrder](https://github.com/datourat/Gorder)
- [pH](https://github.com/kartiklakhotia/graphReordering)
- [Block Reordering](https://github.com/kartiklakhotia/graphReordering)
- [Rabbit reordering](https://github.com/araij/rabbit_order)

## Reordering
Each Folder contains how to run or use reordering method, script, and tools

PS. reordering methods, or scripts should not be run in parallel because they use the same temp file for loggin runtimes and could cause trouble
